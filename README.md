## About The Project

This project was developed by me as a solution to the technical task for QA at the IT academy where I study.
"project-city" is a service that accepts and responds to HTTP requests. Basically, all models and methods are based on objects such as a city, a street, or a store.
This project is basically a simple filtering of stores based on your city and street.
